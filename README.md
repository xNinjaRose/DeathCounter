# DeathCounter

1 - Open Death Counter.exe

2 - Type the name of what you want it to be prefixed (i.e, "Death Count, Fails, Counter", etc. colon is unnecessary)

3 - Press + to increment , - to decrement, r to reset your counter, and q to quit the application

4 - It is saved to Deaths.txt, which can be read from programs like OBS to work with Streaming to show on your overlay. (TextGDI+ Source, and then Read from File)

NOTE: Now it can keep track of what value it had in the text file from previous sessions, so if you had an 8 count, starting the app again will show 8 from the start. If it is empty then it defaults to 0. You can always reset it manually by "R" key
